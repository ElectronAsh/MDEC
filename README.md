# PSX Reimplementation in FPGA
Attempt to do a verilog Implementation of most or all chips in the Playstation 1 (PSX)

As of now the following chips are being remade :
- MDEC (Block decompression for full motion video)
  TODO Remaining : Validation of pixel packing in FIFO, validation of FIFOs under backpressure.
- GPU  (Graphic processor, doing all the rendering and display (seperated modules))
  TODO Remaining : Last command to support read of VRAM to CPU/DMA.
  TODO Remaining : Display side support (rendering is done, but scanning buffer for display is not)
  TODO Remaining : Some more tests ? For now some warnings request checking.
  TODO Remaining : CPU Read from GPU, including last command TODO (related)
- SPU  (Audio chip)
  TODO Remaining : CPU Read from SPU.
  TODO Remaining : Command to read SPU RAM content from CPU/DMA.
- GTE  (Internal extension of the instruction set of the CPU to do 3D computations)
  TODO Implementation to complete, 3rd attempt. Previous attemps should matched the computation specs, but cycle count was off.
